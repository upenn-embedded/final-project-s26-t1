This is the code we use to create the image to flash onto the Raspberry Pi Model 4 B

# Plan
Use NixOS to create a reproducible image

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/upenn-embedded/final-project-s26-t1.git`
2. cd into the repository: `cd final-project-s26-t1`
3. ensure you have [nix](https://nixos.org/download/) installed
4. build the image: `nix build .#packages.aarch64-linux.rpi4B-iso` (you may have to enable cross-compiling for `aarch64-linux` - I'm on NixOS with cross compilation enabled in my system config, so it just works for me)
5. plug-in the SD card into your system
6. Figure out which `disk` you need to flash (BE CAREFUL): `lsblk`
```

```
7. In my case, the disk I need to flash is `sda`, which I can tell based off the size (64GB microSD card)
8. flash the SD card: `sudo dd if=result/sd-image/$(ls result/sd-image/) of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=direct` (replace `sdX` with the drive you determined you need to flash). BE CAREFUL TO NOT OVERWRITE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KEEP
9. put the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi

# Post-Install State
 * Automatically connects to AirPennNet-Device (you will have to register your device's MAC address to get it authorized to the network - you can find you mac address with `ip link` and look for the one associated with `wlan0`)
 * Automatically logs into all TTYs as `root`
 * `root` password is secret, but is already pre-set
 * OpenSSH open on all network interfaces with password login into `root`
 * Some utility packages pre-installed like `htop`, `neovim`, and `fastfetch`
 * Publishes itself to the local network through `avahi` (which you may also have to install) as `etch-a-sketch.local`

# Development Tips
* **connect via ssh**: `ssh root@etch-a-sketch.local`
* **update configuration remotely without re-flashing**
    * NixOS Machines: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#etch-a-sketch --target-host root@etch-a-sketch.local`
